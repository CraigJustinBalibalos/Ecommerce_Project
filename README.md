We will build a marketplace Web Application where a customer can order food online.

1. As a customer, I can look through menu (catalog of the foods)
1. As a customer, I can list the menu by price
1. As a customer, I can view the food description
1. As a customer, I can Add, Delete or Modify the quantity of order
1. As a customer, I can forget my password, and press the option to send the sign in link to my email *
1. As a customer, I can contact the chat support for any questions *
1. As a customer, I can checkout my order
1. As a customer, I can favorite food on the menu, and it will be added to my favorite food section in my profile
1. As a customer, I can check my account and/or change my information (contact and location)
