4. As a customer, I can View the meal description
5. As a customer, I can View the meal visualization
6. As a customer, I can Add, Delete or Modify the quantity of the order
7. As a customer, I can Forget my password, and press the option to send the sign in link to my email *
8. As a customer, I can Contact the chat support for any questions *
9. As a customer, I can Checkout my order
10. As a customer, I can favorite meal on the menu, and it will be Added or Deleted to my favorite meal section in my profile
11. As a customer, I can Check my account and/or Change my information (contact and location)
12. As a customer, I can Check my purchase history and their Details *
13. As a customer, I can Check offers on food
